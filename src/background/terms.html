    <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
    <h2>Important Terms</h2>

    </p>
    <h2>Your Permission to Use the Website</h2>
    <p>Subject to these terms, the company gives you permission to use the website. That permission isn’t exclusive to you, and you can’t transfer it to anyone else. Others need to agree to these terms for themselves to use the website.
    </p>
    <h2>Conditions for Use of the Website</h2>
    <p>Your permission to use the website is subject to the following conditions: <br><br>You must be at least thirteen years old.

       <br>
       <br>You must use the website in accordance with Acceptable Use and Content Standards.</p>
       <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
       <p>You may not break the law using the website.
        <br><br>You may not use or try to use another’s account on the website without their specific permission.
          <br><br>You may not buy, sell, or otherwise trade in user names or other unique identifiers on the website.
          <br><br>You may not send advertisements, chain letters, or other solicitations through the website, or use the website to gather addresses for commercial mailing lists.
          <br><br>You may not automate access to the website, or monitor the website, such as with a web crawler, browser plug-in or add-on, or other computer program that is not a web browser. You may crawl the website to index it for a publicly available search engine.
          <br><br>You may not use the website to send e-mail to distribution lists, newsgroups, or group mail aliases.

       <h2>General Terms</h2>
       <p>If a provision of these terms is unenforceable as written, but could be changed to make it enforceable, that provision should be modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. Otherwise, that provision should be removed.
       <br><br>You may not assign your agreement with the company. The company may assign your agreement to any affiliate of the company, any other company that obtains control of the company, or any other company that buys assets of the company related to the website. Any attempted assignment against these terms has no legal effect.
       <br><br>Neither the exercise of any right under this Agreement, nor waiver of any breach of this Agreement, waives any other breach of this Agreement.
       <br><br>These terms embody all the terms of agreement between you and the company about use of the website. These terms entirely replace any other agreements about your use of the website, written or not.
